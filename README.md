# 20News_groups_ciphertext_casestudy

Overview
Source : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/20-newsgroups-ciphertext-challenge/overview
original dataset :http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/

Firstly, itâ€™s all about encryption which means converting readable text to unreadable text.
The Ciphertext challenge is to find the unreadable text belongs to which group?
Now what are all the groups? There are 20News groups (20 classes) dataset having a 20000 newsgroup documents.
This Problem is a multiclass classification problem.
This problem is not about decrypting the given ciphertext
Problem Statement
classification of ciphertexts are belongs to respective Newsgroups (classes)

20ciphers_Newsgroups consists of ciphertexts

train_dataset consists of :
Ciphertext : An encrypted text of a readable text
ID : A unique ID for each ciphertext
Target : 20 news groups are present, each ciphertext are belongs to one of the news groups
Test_dataset consists of :

Ciphertext : An encrypted text of a readable text
ID : A unique ID for each ciphertext
We need to classify the Target group for given test_dataset ciphertexts.

what is the use?
By just using ML classification techniques we are able to classify Newsgroups without using any cryptographh algorithms
we don't need to use cryptography algorithms to predict the groups ,then How will we classify?
Machine learning Algorithms are using in Every Domain in real world. so, yes in crytpgraphy also we can use ML classification technique's like by converting ciphertext into vectors using tfidf ,word2vec and also used some Basic techniques for Feature
Engineering.
